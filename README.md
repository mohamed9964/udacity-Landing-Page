Starter code taken from udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

This project has the scope of converting a static web page into a single dynamic page.

It uses JavaScript to dynamically create navigation bar links based on the content in the viewport, showing the active state of that section.
